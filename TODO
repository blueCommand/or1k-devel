#### PROGRESS

- Port eglibc!


#### DELAYED

- Why does CFI imply that .eh_frame is always included?
> If I solve this, I can probably remove the ugly -fno-dwarf-asm-thing in gcc
> Normal gcc includes .eh_frame as well - perhaps it should be included?
> 
> A good thing would probably be to compile gcc for x86_54 and compare the outputed crtendS.c with that of openrisc

x64 uses -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables (as we already knew) which fixes crtstuff. So we're on the right track.
Including gnu-user.h added GNU_EH_FRAMES as well which is nice.


#### DONE

- GNU_STACK - do we want it? How?
- Is relro working?
- Is CFI working?
