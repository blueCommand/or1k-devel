#### PROGRESS

- Why does eglibc crash on a simple relocation to __libc_multiple_libcs ?

- Implement TLS, wooho!
  - TLS relocations:      done
  - Resolve relocations:
  - LD? will probably just keep it as GD for now.

#### DELAYED

- Port eglibc!
- Make libc work! :)

- Implement support for DWARF2 exceptions in signal handler (java?)
  Not needed for now.

- For now we use --enable-tls, implement check in configure.ac

- Implement compare and swap atomic in kernel (use syscall or1k_atomic as base).
  Not important right now

#### DONE

- DWARF2 exceptions
- GNU_STACK - do we want it? How?
- Is relro working?
- Is CFI working?
