#### PROGRESS


- Port eglibc!
- Fix vfork
- Fix clone

- Disable eglibc versioning, example define __ASSUME_ATFCTS

- Implement TLS, wooho!
  - TLS relocations:      done
  - Resolve relocations:  static IE/LE done
  - LD? will probably just keep it as GD for now.

#### DELAYED

./ports/sysdeps/or1k/preconfigure:  # TODO: page size correct?


- For now we use --enable-tls, implement check in configure.ac

- Implement compare and swap atomic in kernel (use syscall or1k_atomic as base).
  Not important right now

#### DONE

- Implement support for DWARF2 exceptions in signal handler (java?)
- DWARF2 exceptions
