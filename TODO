#### PROGRESS

- Implement TLS, wooho!
 - Implement ELF relocations
 - Implement set_thread_area syscall

- For now we use --enable-tls, implement check in configure.ac

- Implement compare and swap atomic in kernel (use syscall or1k_atomic as base).

#### DELAYED

- Port eglibc!
- Why won't glibc use -lgcc_eh?
- Make everything compile, not just libc
- Make libc work! :)



- Why does CFI imply that .eh_frame is always included?
> If I solve this, I can probably remove the ugly -fno-dwarf-asm-thing in gcc
> Normal gcc includes .eh_frame as well - perhaps it should be included?
> 
> A good thing would probably be to compile gcc for x86_54 and compare the outputed crtendS.c with that of openrisc

x64 uses -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables (as we already knew) which fixes crtstuff. So we're on the right track.
Including gnu-user.h added GNU_EH_FRAMES as well which is nice.


#### DONE

- GNU_STACK - do we want it? How?
- Is relro working?
- Is CFI working?
